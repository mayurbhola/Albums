#### Tech Stack:
* Kotlin as the main language
* MVVM based project architecture pattern
* ViewBinding for easy view interactions
* Room database for data storage
* Kotlin coroutines and Kotlin flows
* Retrofit for network operation
* GSON for API response parser
* Timber for log utility

#### Recommendations for future improvements:
* Gradle
  * Manage multiple variant like release, prod, staging, qa
  * Manage Gradle libraries versions handling by using gradle extension file by defining values
  * Manage Signing configuration and can handle separate signing build per variant
* Project
  * Can upgrade to jetpack compose
* Data/Source
  * Can use DataBindings
  * Can add pagination
  * Can implement navigation component
* Can implement dependency injection
* For better architectural approach can separate modules like network operation module which handles api call
